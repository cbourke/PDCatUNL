        <p><b>Multitasking</b> can save a lot of time when performing everyday tasks.
          For example, if you need to boil water for cooking a meal, you wouldnâ€™t
          just stand and watch the water warm up to the boiling point. Instead, you
          would work on other tasks like cutting vegetables or measuring how much
          pasta to cook. In a restaurant kitchen, you would need to simultaneously
          coordinate tasks based on various skills and responsibilities to prepare
          dishes. Multitasking does not reduce the total amount of work required,
          but it does let you complete that work in less time.</p>
        <p>Computing takes advantage of similar multitasking concepts, but in
          general, a single processor can execute only one process, task, or
          operation at a time. However, if one operation needs to complete before
          another, such as boiling water before putting pasta into the pot, a
          processor can switch from its current process to perform others
          instead of sitting idle. Modern computers have multiple processors or
          cores so they can perform multiple tasks in parallel. As with preparing
          food, a computer cannot reduce the total amount of work, but parallel
          execution can greatly reduce the overall time needed to execute that work.</p>
        <h2 id="sequential-vs-computing">Sequential vs. Concurrent Computing</h2>
        <h2 id="sequential-computing">Sequential Computing</h2>
        <p><strong>Sequential Computing</strong> is the traditional way we think about
          computing. A program's statements execute in sequential order, one after the
          other. For example, the following "code" has three distinct statements:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-text">
        statement A<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        statement B<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        statement C<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>each statement would execute in the order written: first <code>A</code>,
          then <code>B</code>, then <code>C</code>. Importantly, a statement would
          only execute after the previous statement completely finishes. If a
          statement consists of multiple operations, the whole expression would
          be evaluated before moving on. This next example shows an addition and
          subtraction which must both be done before assigning the value to the
          variable <code>r</code>:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-text">
        <span class="hljs-attribute">r</span> = x + y - z;
        <span class="hljs-attribute">statement</span> B;
        </code></pre>
        <p>and only after that would <code>statement B</code> execute. We can visualize
          these sequential operations as general tasks that must be completed
          before beginning the next task along a timeline.</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/img/sequential.png" class="img-fluid col-9 rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Sequential Computing" title="Sequential Computing"></p>
        <p>This chart shows how each task must fully execute before beginning the next task.</p>
        <h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency through Asynchronicity and Parallel Computing</h2>
        <p>Weâ€™ve seen how sequential computing can be inefficient because only
          one task can be done at a time, but certain other tasks could be done
          simultaneously. It wouldnâ€™t matter if you are only able to do one thing
          at a time, but if you can multitask, you can work more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Concurrency is the ability of a computer to perform different tasks
          (or even different parts of a program or algorithm) at the same time,
          not necessarily in sequential order, without affecting behavior or
          correctness of a program.</p>
        <p>We can achieve concurrency computing through two main
          approaches: asynchonicity or parallelism.</p>
        <h2 id="asynchronicity">Asynchronicity</h2>
        <p>Software often needs to perform several tasks which do not need to
          be done sequentially. This is true for most graphical interfaces which
          allow users to interact with a program in multiple different ways. For
          example, word processors let you continue to type whether you manually
          save or auto-save the document. Video games let you to continue
          playing while new obstacles or enemies appear or disappear. You would
          become very frustrated if games froze frequently to redraw all the
          items and characters. Instead, these kinds of tasks can be performed
          asynchronously without blocking execution of other tasks.</p>
        <p>Compare the sequential timeline above with this timeline which shows
          how two tasks can switch back and forth (interleave). In the sequential
          timeline, the second task was prevented from starting until the first
          task completed. With asynchronous execution tasks can start and
          complete without waiting for other tasks to start or complete:</p>
        <p><img src="./assets/img/asynchronous.png" class="img-fluid col-9 rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Asynchronous Computing" title="Asynchronous Computing"></p>
        <p>In this example, Task 1 executes for some time and then is blocked
          while Task 2 executes for some other amount of time. Task 1 then
          takes over again and this trading continues until each task completes.
          Note that only one task executes at a time, but multiple tasks can
          execute asynchronously. This can provide a huge time savings.</p>
        <p>If Task 1 had to wait for the result of Task 2, Task 1 would sit
          idle until it received that result. Even worse, other tasks would
          sit idle or be blocked until Task 1 completed. Blocked tasks can
          cause your computer to freeze up entirely and require rebooting.</p>
        <h2 id="parallel-computing">Parallel Computing</h2>
        <p>Another way we can achieve concurrency is through parallel computing,
          which means more than one task executes at the same time.</p>
        <p>Generally, parallel computing requires each task to execute on a
          different processor or core, but the advantage is clear: if we execute
          more than one task at the same time, the overall time required to
          complete all tasks can be reduced significantly. For example, if the
          time required to complete all tasks sequentially is 20 seconds but
          we evenly divide it among 4 processors, the total "wall clock" time
          would only be 5 seconds!</p>
        <p>This brief explanation of concurrency and how we can achieve it
          avoids the technical details and challenges of implementing it, and
          many tasks cannot leverage concurrent techniques. The goal of this
          introduction is to give you a basic idea of how it works and set
          the foundation for some demonstrations that do not require you to
          code or be an expert in concurrent programming.</p>

        <h2 id="slowing-things-down">Slowing Things Down</h2>
        <p>Ironically, , we often do not want computers to execute tasks as
          quickly as possible. For example, there are many times when we want
          computations to occur gradually so we can perceive changes which
          would otherwise happen faster than our human eyes appreciate. Instead
          of watching a two-minute video a 2x speed (taking one minute to
          watch), what if your computer played it at 60x (taking two seconds
          to watch)?</p>

              <li>How did the animations differ? Which was better
                from a human perspective?</li>
              <li>Why did you not see a gradual transition in the
                sequential demonstration?</li>
              <li>In the asynchronous demonstration, do you think
                "waiting" was blocking other tasks from executing? What
                would be the effect if it were blocking?</li>
            </ol>

        <p>Click the Async Demo 2 link in the dropdown menu for this Module
          or open it in a new tab. This demonstration shows the differences
          between a sequential task which blocks other tasks compared to an
          asynchronous task which does not.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Interact with the <code>Say Hello!</code> button and the <code>Action</code> drop-down to see how
        they work.</li>
        <li>Click the <code>Sequential Operation</code> button which will perform an &quot;expensive&quot;
        sequential computation.  While it is executing attempt to interact with the
        <code>Say Hello!</code> button and the <code>Action</code> drop down.  You can rerun the sequential
        operation as many times as you need to observe the results.</li>
        <li>Now click the <code>Asynchronous Operation</code> button which will perform an
        asynchronous computation by connecting to a remote server.  While that asynchronous task
        is executing, interact with the <code>Say Hello!</code> button and the <code>Action</code>
        drop-down menu.  </li>
        <li>Answer the following questions:<ul>
        <li>What did you observe when interacting with the interface while the
        sequential operation was executing?</li>
        <li>What did you observe when interacting with the interface while the
        asynchronous operation was executing?</li>
        <li>What are the consequences of sequential vs asynchronous operations?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="parallel-computing-demonstration">Parallel Computing Demonstration</h1>
        <p>Click the Parallel Demo link in the drop-down menu for this Module or open
          it in a new tab. This demo is a simulation and visualization of parallel
          computing. The simulation generates a certain number of tasks and places
          them in a "job queue" where they wait to be executed. You can select the
          number of tasks to generate and how long they will take to execute. You
          can make them all take the same number of seconds from two to six or they
          will be randomized by default. You can also specify how many processors
          each simulation can use.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Run the simulation with only 1 processor and 10 tasks and observe the results.  Note
        that the total CPU time (upper right) is equal to the total &quot;wall clock&quot; time.</li>
        <li>Run the simulation again with 2 processors and the same number of tasks.  </li>
        <li>Run the simulation again with 4 processors.</li>
        <li>Play around with the simulation with a different number of tasks, processors, and
        times and answer the following:<ul>
        <li>When you went from 1 processor to 2 processors what was the difference in the
        <em>elapsed time</em> you observed?  What about the difference from 2 to 4 processors?</li>
        <li>When you went from 1 processor to 2 processors what was the difference in the
        <em>CPU time</em> you observed?  What about the difference from 2 to 4 processors?</li>
        <li>Was the work (number of tasks) always equally distributed among all the processors?
        Why or why not?</li>
        <li>Was the work (total time) always equally distributed among all the processors?
        Why or why not?</li>
        </ul>
