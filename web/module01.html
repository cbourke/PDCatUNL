        <p><em>Multitasking</em> can save a lot of time when performing everyday tasks.  When
        cooking, while waiting for the water to boil you don&#39;t just stand around
        watching the pot; you perform other tasks (cutting vegetables, measuring
        pasta, etc.).  With larger more complex jobs, you may have multiple people
        working together.  A restaurant would employ multiple staff - a chef to
        prepare entrees, another to prepare deserts, etc.  Each person performs
        a different task <em>at the same time</em>.  Having more individuals performing
        tasks doesn&#39;t reduce the actual amount of <em>work</em>, it just makes it
        possible to complete the work in a shorter amount of time.</p>
        <p>In computing, these concepts are similar.  In general, only one process,
        task, or operation can be performed on a single processor at a time.<br>However, if an operation (boiling water) needs to complete before a
        task (cooking) can be completed, the processor can switch what it is
        doing so that it is not &quot;idle&quot; until the operation is completed.  Similarly,
        modern computers have multiple processors or cores that enable them to
        perform multiple tasks at once <em>in parallel</em>.  Just as with preparing food,
        the total amount of work is not reduced, but we may be able to execute
        all the work in a shorter amount of actual time.</p>
        <h2 id="sequential-computing">Sequential Computing</h2>
        <p><strong>Sequential Computing</strong> is the usually the default way we think about computing.
        A program&#39;s statements are executed one after the other.  For example, if we
        consider the following &quot;code&quot;:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-text">
        statement A<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        statement B<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        statement C<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>each statement would execute in the order they are written: first <code>A</code> then
        <code>B</code> then <code>C</code>.  In addition, the next statement would only execute after the
        previous statement has <em>completely finished</em>.  If a statement
        consisted of more than one operation, for example an addition and a subtraction:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-text">
        <span class="hljs-attribute">r</span> = x + y - z;
        <span class="hljs-attribute">statement</span> B;
        </code></pre>
        <p>the entire expression would be evaluated and assigned to the variable <code>r</code> before
        statement <code>B</code> would begin.  We can visualize these operations as more general
        <em>tasks</em> that have to be completed one after the other as <em>time</em> moves forward.</p>
        <p><img src="../web/assets/img/sequential.png" class="img-fluid col-9 rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Sequential Computing" title="Sequential Computing"></p>
        <p>As you can see only one task is executed at any one moment of time and each
        task executes <em>fully</em> before the next task begins.</p>
        <h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>
        <p>Sequential computing is somewhat limiting, it means that only one thing can be
        done at a time even if those things <em>could</em> be done at the same time.  If you
        only have the ability to do one thing at a time then it doesn&#39;t really matter
        but if you do have the ability to <em>multitask</em> and do more than one thing at the
        same time then it has the potential to speed up</p>
        <p><em>Concurrency</em> is the ability for different tasks (or different parts of a program
        or algorithm) can be executed out-of-order without affecting the results.<br>Concurrency can take several different forms in computing.  </p>
        <h2 id="asynchronicity">Asynchronicity</h2>
        <p>A program may need perform several tasks that do not necessarily need to be
        done sequentially.  This is often the case in <em>user interfaces</em> in which a
        human user can interact with a program in multiple different ways.  A word
        processor allows you to continue typing as it is saving your document.  A
        game allows you to continue playing as it generates and controls enemies around
        you.  These tasks are usually performed <em>asynchronously</em>: tasks are
        performed concurrently without <em>blocking</em> the execution of other tasks.  </p>
        <p>With sequential computing, the second task was prevented from starting or
        executing before the first task was complete.  However, with asynchronous
        execution, two tasks can be interleaved:</p>
        <p><img src="../web/assets/img/asynchronous.png" class="img-fluid col-9 rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Sequential Computing" title="Sequential Computing"></p>

        <p>In this example, Task 1 executes for a time and then is <em>blocked</em> while
        Task 2 executes.  Then, Task 1 takes over again and the trade-off continues
        until each task is done.  At any one time, only one task is executing,
        but they can be done asynchronously.  This gives a huge advantage with
        respect to saving time.  Suppose one task has to wait for the result of
        another task.  If the task simply continued executing by doing nothing
        while it waited for the result it would be waiting and prevent
        or &quot;block&quot; other tasks from executing.  Instead of this &quot;busy waiting&quot;,
        it can pause its execution and allow another task to execute while it waits.</p>
        <h2 id="parallel-computing">Parallel Computing</h2>
        <p>Another way that concurrency can be achieved is through parallel computing.
        This is when more than one task executes <em>at the same time</em>.  </p>
        <p><img src="../web/assets/img/parallel.png" class="img-fluid col-9 rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Sequential Computing" title="Sequential Computing"></p>
        <p>This generally requires that each task execute on a different processor or
        core.  However, the advantage is clear: with the ability to execute more
        than one task at the same time, the overall time required to complete all
        tasks can be reduced significantly.  For example, if the time required to
        complete all tasks in parallel is 20 seconds and we evenly divide it
        among 4 processors, the total &quot;wall clock&quot; time would only be 20 / 4 = 5
        seconds!</p>
        <p>Of course we have omitted a lot of details and issues surrounding concurrent
        programming (some problems may not even be able to be solved using concurrency!).
        However, this is enough of an introduction to get started with some codeless
        demonstrations.  </p>

        <h2 id="slowing-things-down">Slowing Things Down</h2>
        <p>Ironically, sometimes we want <em>slower</em> computations, or more accurately, we
        want a computation to occur over a specific amount of time that can be perceived
        by the human eye.</p>

        <li>How did the results differ?  Which one was better from a human perspective?</li>
        <li>Why did you not observe a graduate transition in the sequential demonstration?</li>
        <li>In the asynchronous demonstration, do you think the &quot;waiting&quot; was blocking
        (it prevented other tasks from executing) or not?  What would be the effect
        if it were blocking?</li>

        <li>Interact with the <code>Say Hello!</code> button and the <code>Action</code> drop down to see how
        they work.</li>
        <li>Click the <code>Sequential Operation</code> button which will perform an &quot;expensive&quot;
        sequential computation.  While it is executing attempt to interact with the
        <code>Say Hello!</code> button and the <code>Action</code> drop down.  You can rerun the sequential
        operation as many times as you need to observe the results.</li>
        <li>Now click the <code>Asynchronous Operation</code> button which will perform an
        asynchronous computation by connecting to a remote server.  Again, while it is
        executing, attempt to interact with the
        <code>Say Hello!</code> button and the <code>Action</code> drop down.  </li>
        <li>Answer the following questions:<ul>
        <li>What did you observe when trying to interact with the interface while the
        sequential operation was executing?</li>
        <li>What did you observe when trying to interact with the interface while the
        asynchronous operation was executing?</li>
        <li>What are the consequences of sequential vs asynchronous operations?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="parallel-computing-demonstration">Parallel Computing Demonstration</h1>
        <p>Open the <code>Parallel Demo</code> page.  This is a simulation/visualization of parallel
        computing.  The simulation will generate a certain number of tasks and place
        them in a &quot;job queue&quot; where they will wait to be executed.  You can select
        the number of tasks to generate as well as how long they will take to execute
        (you can make them all take the same number of seconds 2-6 or they will
        be randomized by default).  You can also specify how many processors each
        simulation will have.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Run the simulation with only 1 processor and 10 tasks and observe the results.  Note
        that the total CPU time (upper right) is equal to the total &quot;wall clock&quot; time.</li>
        <li>Run the simulation again with 2 processors and the same number of tasks.  </li>
        <li>Run the simulation again with 4 processors.</li>
        <li>Play around with the simulation with a different number of tasks, processors and
        time(s) and answer the following:<ul>
        <li>When you went from 1 processor to 2 processors what was the difference in the
        <em>elapsed time</em> you observed?  When you went from 2 processors to 4 what was
        the difference observed?</li>
        <li>When you went from 1 processor to 2 processors what was the difference in the
        <em>CPU time</em> you observed?  When you went from 2 processors to 4 what was
        the difference observed?</li>
        <li>Was the work (number of tasks) always equally distributed among all the processors?
        Why or why not?</li>
        <li>Was the work (total time) always equally distributed among all the processors?
        Why or why not?</li>
        </ul>
